# How it works

It use `frida-core` to inject `Finder.app` and `frida-gum` to replace some syscall including `open`, `openx_np`, `getattrlist`, `setattrlist`.

Whenever `Finder` try call these function with `.DS_Store` file, it will replace the path to a fake one under the odourless cage directory `/usr/local/var/.odourless_cage`.

It doesn't delete `.DS_Store`, but it places all `.DS_Store` into one directory that you don't care about.
